# Minutiae
Minutiae is the Latin plural of minutia: a small detail. I often direct a lot of thought toward minutiae in my life, and lately, I feel compelled to write about them. I anticipate this blog will slowly fill with articles, stories, poems, and other written tidbits related to the minutiae I find interesting. Through Gitlab, I have found an easy way to "publish" these, making them available for my family and friends.

I prefer this to social media because there are no expectations here, and I have more control over the format.

My partner Kylea informed me that based on this bio, what I'm creating is basically a Tumblr page.
