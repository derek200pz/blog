This is a poem I wrote while I was sitting on a small bridge over a small creek in the middle of a small stripe of forest surrounded by farmland. I was walking Khaleesi.

    Clear as glass, the pass of daylight shows
    To touch and look, the brook does not oppose
    But through the gleaming stream, what humor flows?
    Collect some dirt; alertly decompose

    For years, our peers have penned observant prose
    We've studied; ruddied up our book-stained nose
    And still the spill of melancholy grows
    We kill for nill and naught, but here we doze. 

    But soon, the brook will look no more like chrome
    Its babbling muffled, stuffed with palid foam
    And still our kin will din and tramp and roam
    Our compass set: regretful loxodrome.

    Don't cry! For why not settle in the stars?
    Preserve deserving servants up on mars?
    To claim this aim sedates our proles and tsars
    Asleep, we'll reap the fitting fate that's ours

Human beings are so inextricably tied together. We are like a hive of bees, or a nest of ants. We could even be considered cells in a body; one single organism: the human race. Neurons that communicate through spoken word; fiber-optic nerves and asphalt veins carrying steel blood. One giant spherical being, a bioshpere which has gained awareness of itself.

Except, has it gained awareness of itself? Individual humans are self-aware, but is humanity as a whole, when considered as one organism, self-aware?

This poem explores the idea that humanity, the great single being, is sleeping. Will it wake up before climate change drastically alters its body (i.e. us, the people)?
